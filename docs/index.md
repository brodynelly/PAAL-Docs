## Quick Start

I recommend starting with the [High-Level System Architecture](./architecture/high-level-system.md) document to get a broad understanding of the system, followed by the Overall Architecture documents for both [Frontend](./frontend/overall-architecture.md) and [Backend](./backend/overall-architecture.md).

## Contributing to Documentation
