# Deployment Process

## Overview

This document outlines the deployment process for the PAAL system, including environments, CI/CD pipeline configuration, deployment procedures, and rollback strategies.

## Deployment Environments

The PAAL system uses multiple environments to ensure quality and stability:

| Environment | Purpose | Access | Update Frequency |
|-------------|---------|--------|------------------|
| Development | Active development and testing | Developers only | Continuous |
| Staging | Pre-production testing and validation | Internal team | After feature completion |
| Production | Live system for end users | End users | Scheduled releases |

## Infrastructure Architecture

The system is deployed using a containerized architecture:

```

## Deployment Procedures

### Development Deployment

Development deployments occur automatically when code is pushed to the `develop` branch:

1. Developer pushes code to `develop` branch
2. CI/CD pipeline builds and tests the code
3. If tests pass, the code is deployed to the development environment
4. Developers verify changes in the development environment

### Staging Deployment

Staging deployments occur after feature completion and QA approval:

1. QA team approves features in development environment
2. Release manager creates a release branch from `develop`
3. CI/CD pipeline builds and tests the code
4. If tests pass, the code is deployed to the staging environment
5. QA team performs regression testing in staging
6. If testing passes, the release branch is merged to `main`

### Production Deployment

Production deployments follow a scheduled release cycle:

1. Release manager initiates deployment from the `main` branch
2. CI/CD pipeline builds and tests the code
3. If tests pass, a manual approval step is required
4. After approval, the code is deployed to production
5. Deployment is performed using a rolling update strategy
6. Monitoring systems verify the health of the new deployment
7. If issues are detected, automatic rollback is triggered

## Step-by-Step Deployment Procedure

### 1. Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All feature branches are merged to `develop`
- [ ] All tests are passing in the CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] QA team has approved the release
- [ ] Release notes are prepared
- [ ] Database migration scripts are reviewed
- [ ] Rollback plan is in place

### 2. Database Migration

Database migrations are performed before code deployment:

```bash
# Connect to the database server
ssh db-admin@db-server

# Run database migrations
cd /opt/paal/scripts
./run-migrations.sh --env=production
```

### 3. Code Deployment

Code deployment is performed through the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Trigger the deployment workflow in GitHub Actions
2. Monitor the deployment progress in the GitHub Actions UI
3. Verify the deployment status in Kubernetes:

```bash
# Check deployment status
kubectl get deployments

# Check pod status
kubectl get pods

# Check logs
kubectl logs deployment/paal-frontend
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, perform verification steps:

- [ ] Application health checks are passing
- [ ] Key functionality is working as expected
- [ ] Monitoring systems show normal operation
- [ ] No errors in application logs
- [ ] Performance metrics are within expected ranges

## Rollback Procedures

If issues are detected after deployment, a rollback may be necessary:

### Automatic Rollback

The system is configured for automatic rollback if health checks fail:

```yaml
# Kubernetes deployment configuration
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0
  minReadySeconds: 30
  revisionHistoryLimit: 10
```

### Manual Rollback

For manual rollback, follow these steps:

1. Identify the previous stable version:

```bash
# List deployment revisions
kubectl rollout history deployment/paal-frontend
```

2. Rollback to the previous version:

```bash
# Rollback to the previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/paal-frontend

# Or rollback to a specific revision
kubectl rollout undo deployment/paal-frontend --to-revision=2
```

3. Verify the rollback:

```bash
# Check rollback status
kubectl rollout status deployment/paal-frontend

# Verify the application is running the correct version
kubectl describe deployment paal-frontend
```

### Database Rollback

If database migrations need to be rolled back:

```bash
# Connect to the database server
ssh db-admin@db-server

# Run database rollback script
cd /opt/paal/scripts
./rollback-migration.sh --env=production --version=previous
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

The deployed application is monitored using several tools:

### Health Checks

Kubernetes performs regular health checks:

```yaml
# Health check configuration
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /api/health
    port: 3000
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /api/ready
    port: 3000
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
```

### Logging

Application logs are collected and centralized:

- **Log Collection**: Fluentd collects logs from all containers
- **Log Storage**: Elasticsearch stores logs for analysis
- **Log Visualization**: Kibana provides a UI for log analysis

### Metrics

Application and system metrics are collected and monitored:

- **Metric Collection**: Prometheus collects metrics from all components
- **Metric Visualization**: Grafana provides dashboards for metrics
- **Alerting**: Alertmanager sends alerts based on metric thresholds

### Alerting Rules

Alerts are configured for critical issues:

```yaml
# Prometheus alerting rules
groups:
- name: paal-alerts
  rules:
  - alert: HighErrorRate
    expr: sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) > 0.05
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: High error rate detected
      description: More than 5% of requests are failing
  
  - alert: HighResponseTime
    expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le)) > 2
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: High response time detected
      description: 95th percentile of response time is above 2 seconds
```

## Disaster Recovery

The system includes disaster recovery procedures:

### Backup Strategy

- **Database**: Daily automated backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Configuration**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) stored in version control
- **Application**: Container images stored in registry with version tags

### Recovery Procedure

In case of a major outage:

1. Identify the cause of the outage
2. Restore the most recent database backup
3. Deploy the last known stable version of the application
4. Verify system functionality
5. Gradually restore traffic to the system

## Security Considerations

Deployments follow security best practices:

- **Secrets Management**: Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive information
- **Network Security**: Network policies restrict communication between components
- **Image Security**: Container images are scanned for vulnerabilities
- **Access Control**: RBAC controls access to deployment resources

## Continuous Improvement

The deployment process is continuously improved:

- **Post-Deployment Reviews**: After each deployment, the team reviews the process
- **Metrics Collection**: Deployment metrics (duration, success rate, etc.) are collected
- **Automation**: Manual steps are identified and automated where possible
- **Documentation**: Deployment documentation is updated based on lessons learned
